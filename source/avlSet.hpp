 * AVL tree-building program adapted from Pascal procedures
 * 4.63 (p. 220) and 4.64 (p. 223) of Nicklaus Wirth's textbook,
 * "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" with correction
 * of the bug in the del procedure and bifurcation of that
 * procedure into the eraseLeft and eraseRight methods.  The
 * eraseRight method performs the identical operations to del,
 * whereas the eraseLeft method performs the mirror-image
 * operations to eraseRight in an attempt to improve rebalancing
 * efficiency after deletion.
 *
 * To build the test executable, compile via: g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -D TEST_AVL_TREE avlTree.cpp

The following changes were made to the original https://github.com/chezruss/avl-tree

1.  The file name and outer class were change to avlSet.
2.  All the "using *" commands were moved to the test section of the code.
